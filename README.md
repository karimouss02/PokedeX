# PokedeX
The three images have to be downloaded and implemented within the "PokedeX" project, so that you can get the images of each icon, any questions are accepted.

In this project, we didn't have well planned how to do the Agenda at the beggining, so, what we did, was making small proves and researching using forums as well as AI's. Little by little it started to be something and we could implement new functions, although we had some problems related to some aspects of the project, we could solve them, basically because we couldn't figure out things that we don't actually know.

We ended up with a very basic agenda, but it was functional and eficient. But, at the start, we had in mind doing a 'Pokédex', so we used what we had done, the agenda, and we changed it to a most nerd aspect, such as the 'Pokédex'. Finally, we could finish the project satisfied and proud with our job.

After this days, it is know that projects like this, despite being small and basic, they feed our desire for learning and discovering new things and functions that we didn't have in mind.

End of the project, thank you.
